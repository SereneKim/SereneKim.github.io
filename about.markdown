Hello, I am a Ph.D. student at [Data Analytics Laboratory (Data Lab)](http://data.research.vub.be/) at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB, Free University of Brussels - Flemish Part). With my interdisciplinary background, having studied Sociology (BSc from VUB) and Statistics and Data Science (MSc from KU Leuven), I joined the inter-university project, [Ancestor's Tale: 200 years of wealth inequality and redistributive policy](https://ancestorstale.be/en#:~:text=The%20project%20%E2%80%9CAncestor's%20Tale%E2%80%9D%20studies,of%20200%20years%20in%20Belgium.). This project involves experts of different research fields (History, Sociology, Economics, Physics and Data Science) from three Flemish universities -- KU Leuven, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and Universiteit Antwerpen. 

I am interested in **computational modeling** of complex systems and enjoy thinking about measures and metrics. Within the Ancestor's Tale project, I aim to explore the evolution of wealth mobility and dynamics in Belgium's past. My goal is to build a computational model that facilitates the exploration of various latent factors driving inequality and wealth distribution over time. I am also interested in **data visualization** and **large language models**! 

Besides researching, I also do graphic design! For instance, I created banners to represent the research topics of my teammates at [the Data Lab website](https://data.research.vub.be/research). You can see the archive [here](/blog).
